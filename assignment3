Objectives using Selective Search in R-CNN
Selective Search: This algorithm generates potential object region proposals in images. These proposals are then classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Phases involved in R-CNN
Region Proposal:

Selective Search is used to generate potential bounding boxes or regions in the image that might contain objects.
Warping and Normalizing:

Each proposed region is warped to a fixed size and normalized to match the input requirements of the CNN.
Feature Extraction:

A pre-trained CNN (like AlexNet, VGG, or ResNet) is used to extract features from these fixed-size regions.
Classification and Regression:

An SVM classifier is trained on the extracted features to classify each region.
A regression model refines the bounding box coordinates.
Clean-up:

Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is applied to remove duplicate detections and finalize the bounding boxes.
Implementation of Counting:

An additional counting algorithm might be implemented to count objects within detected regions, but this is not standard in R-CNN frameworks.

SVM Implementation in R-CNN
In R-CNN, after feature extraction by the CNN, an SVM classifier is trained for object classification. Each proposed region's features serve as the input to the SVM.
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)
NMS is used to filter out overlapping bounding boxes by selecting the box with the highest confidence score and suppressing the others that have significant overlap.
Fast R-CNN Improvements Over R-CNN
Single-stage training: Fast R-CNN integrates the feature extraction, classification, and bounding box regression into a single model, making it faster and more efficient.
ROI Pooling: It uses ROI pooling to handle different region sizes, allowing the CNN to process the whole image just once.
Mathematical Intuition for ROI Pooling in Fast R-CNN
ROI pooling converts different-sized regions of interest into fixed-size feature maps so that they can be fed into fully connected layers.
Changes in Classifier Activation in Fast R-CNN
Fast R-CNN uses a softmax function for classification and a linear function for bounding box regression, improving performance and accuracy.
Major Changes in Faster R-CNN
Region Proposal Network (RPN): Introduced to generate region proposals directly from the feature maps, replacing the selective search.
Anchors: Used by the RPN to propose regions of different sizes and aspect ratios.
Concept of Anchor Boxes
Anchors are predefined bounding boxes of different scales and aspect ratios used to predict object locations. They help the RPN suggest regions efficiently.
